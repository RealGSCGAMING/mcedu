<h1>These are my Minecraft Education Edition maps.</h1>
<h2>Descriptions:</h2>
<h3>GSC's Parkour</h3>
<p>GSC's Parkour is a simple parkour map. There are 10 levels, and a winners section at the end. It also includes a level select function and some secret easter eggs!</p>

<p>Mountain Minigames is a small collection of minigames that are played on or near a mountain. There are currently 2 games that can be played with as many players as you want, and I plan to add more in the future. There is a King of the Hill style PVP game and a Spleef minigame available. Keep an eye out for hidden secrets!</p>
